This is my first selfmade project 
just simple file-exchanger site with preview of files

without authorization

consists of three pages
1. index - dropzone for files with indication of loading (which indicate only to-server-loading )
2. list - of files, that you have link to with download link (that looks like button) and timer
3. oops - page if files does not exist on drive (google drive to be pre—Åise)

it works fine with jpeg/png images but does not show tif or other raw photos in preview
also cannot play video yet
